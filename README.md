# E-commerce-database-system

This project represents a simple e-commerce database system designed to manage products, users, categories, and orders. It organizes information into structured tables, including Products, Users, Categories, Orders, and Order Items, making it easy to track inventory, customer details, and purchase history. The workflow begins with defining products and their categories, followed by storing user information and linking them to orders. Each order records the total price and is connected to specific order items, which capture product details, quantities, and prices at the time of purchase. This structured process ensures clarity, scalability, and reliability, providing a foundation for building applications such as online stores, inventory management systems, or sales reporting tools.
